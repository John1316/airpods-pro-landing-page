# Airpod Pro Site Animation

 	The steps I made to make air pods page
1.	The first I searched on google “air pods pro page js”
2.	I get to 2 videos with links “https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OcAAj8aqS8”, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLUJ9VNzZXo
3.	After that I decided to make the image the image sequence first through link

4.	I searched for the text and sequence animation so I get 3 libraries such as “Scroll magic” and “Tween max” and “animation GSAB”
5.	I go through such a big problems in text animation but I solved it through documentation
6.	After that I realized that the last section that scroll horizontal can’t made with animation except if we made it with slider that scroll horizontal so I made it with swiper animation
7.	I added some animation like fade in 

 	The problem I faced:

1.	I didn’t get the last animation in the first section so I searched out of the box in the sliders 
2.	I didn’t change the topic because I saw that apple airpods was enough to introduce the task
3.	At first I made the video instead of image sequence but I realized that image was pretty good and it has an end to catch it
